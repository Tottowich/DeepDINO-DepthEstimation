# DeepDINO-DepthEstimation 🦖

DeepDINO is a supervised depth estimation model that leverages the DINOv2 backbone for rich visual representations. DINO, which stands for Self-Supervised Vision Transformers, is introduced in the paper [Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193).
